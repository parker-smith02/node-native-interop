# Super basic example of an addition function with native C++ code

### To setup:
1. Install node-gyp globally with `sudo npm install -g node-gyp`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node-gyp configure`
4. Run `node-gyp build`. This command builds the C++ code and should be run any time changes are made to the native code
5. Run `node index.ts` to run the program
